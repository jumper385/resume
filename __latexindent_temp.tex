    \section{Professional Summary}
    I’m a UWA Electrical Engineering and Management Student with skills in machine learning, web development \& IT management and mechatronic design. I currently work at UWA Motorsports and Engineers Without Borders as an Electrical Engineer and Altronics as a Sales Assistant. I was previously involved with Noisy Guts as a data scientist and automation engineer
    
    \section{Technical Skills}
    \begin{multicols}{2}
        \subsection{Embedded Systems, Automation and Electronics Engineering}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Primarily working with STM32 and Arduino Microcontrollers on UWA Motorsports – Interfacing with the rest of the car using CAN Bus
        \item Experience with IoT and remote monitoring – built a camera stabilizer that streamed its control variables to a simulated webserver and displayed it on a real-time frontend
        \item Currently leading a team of five to create a remote monitoring module for Engineers Without Borders – creating the electronics and software that can be attached to existing solutions help assess its feasibility and performance.
        \item Breaking down and documenting client requirements and translating them into design tasks
        \item Altium, KiCAD, Solidworks and Fusion 360 Experience for PCB and Hardware Design
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Machine Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Worked with Python for four years – cleaning raw data, finding features and building models for classification and regression and natural language processing
        \item Engineered features from a sparse dataset and applied the abstracted signal to successfully find relationships with other parts of our dataset in the Noisy Guts Project
        \item Applied data-cleaning and data visualization techniques for dataset feasibility testing
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Full stack web development \& IT Management}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Worked with technologies including Flutter, React, Express, Socket.IO and Docker for three years – building full stack web and mobile apps.
        \item Prototyped a data-collection application for The Noisy Guts Project – applying UX/UI design principles, implementing a Realtime backend \& iterating upon the app based on user feedback
        \item Built, Deployed and Managed UWA’s University Engineers’ Club’s website using Docker, NodeJS and MongoDB – implementing a full stack solution that handles role-based authentication, server-side rendering and content management. https://uec.org.au
    \end{itemize}
